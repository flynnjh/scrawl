Frontend:

- [ ] Implement proper design system:
  - im thinking like a note taking sort of app. the sidebar could be a representation of a spiral notebook or bookmark system?
  - clean, modern but playful.
  - the whole interface should feel inviting for the user to spill their heart out, right now it feels like a corporate app.
